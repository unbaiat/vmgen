\chapter*{Abstract}

Virtualization is one of the hot topics in today's IT industry and academia. 
Whether it is used for commercial or educational purposes, it's growing 
popularity is a testimony to the many advantages if offers.

However, the process of creating and configuring virtual machine is time 
consuming, as it is done manually by users. Solutions that automatize this 
process are rare and do not provide a common interface for different 
virtualization technologies.

In this paper, we present \emph{vmgen}, a new tool which tries to fix 
these issues, automating and simplyfing the creation and the system and 
software configuration of virtual machines. It is a tool that aims at saving 
both time and energy, for technical and non-technical users.
