Virtualization is widely used today, and sometimes the process of creating and
configuring virtual machines is time consuming. Sometimes, the need to
configure multiple similar machines occurs, and it would be better to avoid
repeating the same operations manually. The generation process consists of
relatively simple operations, which can be automated. \project attempts to
achieve this goal. It is a tool that allows the user to request a virtual
machine with a specified, configured, operating system installed on it and with
a list of applications to be installed. Then the virtual machine is generated
and configured, and an archive containing the virtual machine is provided to
the user. The user must provide the configuration file, written from scratch,
or altered through the vmgCtl utility. In the future there might be a Web
interface to ease the generation of the configuration file.
